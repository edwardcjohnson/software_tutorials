SublimeREPL let’s you run an interpreter inside of a Sublime Text window. We will use this to run an R or python console from within Sublime Text.

1. Open Sublime
2. Enter `Ctrl+Shift+P`
3. type install and click on the command to install packages. 
4. Search for SublimeREPL and install it. 

##Usage

1.Open up an R console by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` and typing REPL R. Once you do this a few times you’ll be able to just type R and it will come up. 
2. Change your view to have two windows by entering `Alt+Shift+2` 

There are three options for running your code. To run the current line or your selected lines, press `Ctrl+Shift+,,l`. To run just the selected text, press `Ctrl+Shift+,,s`. To run the entire file, press `Ctrl+Shift+,,f`. The R console in Sublime Text behaves exactly like your typical R console, but now it has all of the features of Sublime Text (autocomplete, syntax highlighting, etc.).
