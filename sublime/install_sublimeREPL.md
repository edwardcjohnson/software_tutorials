First, we need to install Package Control. Go here and follow the instructions to install it. To install a package, press `Ctrl+Shift+P`, type install and click on the command to install packages. Search for SublimeREPL and install it. SublimeREPL let’s you run an interpreter inside of a Sublime Text window. We will use this to run an R console from within Sublime Text.

##Usage

Open up an R console by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` and typing REPL R. Once you do this a few times you’ll be able to just type R and it will come up. I recommend changing your view to have two windows `Alt+Shift+2` so you can have your R code on the left and your R console on the right. You can also separate them into two different windows and have them each on their own monitor.

There are three options for running your code. To run the current line or your selected lines, press `Ctrl+Shift+,,l`. To run just the selected text, press `Ctrl+Shift+,,s`. To run the entire file, press `Ctrl+Shift+,,f`. The R console in Sublime Text behaves exactly like your typical R console, but now it has all of the features of Sublime Text (autocomplete, syntax highlighting, etc.).
