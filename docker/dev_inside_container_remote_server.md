                * sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

    * Rename newly created container

        * connect to server vis ssh

        * run docker ps command to list running containers

        * locate your container by the most recent one with respect to CREATED column

        * rename the container (current name is in the NAMES column)
          * docker rename <current name> <project name>_<user nickname>
